# From Windows to Ubuntu: Unlocking a Developer’s Full Potential Through Dual Boot
###  Linux for Development 
Unix-based systems have long held a competitive edge over Windows when it comes to development. While WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) allows Windows users to tap into Linux’s power, persistent bugs and quirks can slow you down. Virtual machines like VMware are an alternative, but they often come with performance trade-offs. For developers who want reliability, speed, and full control, dual-booting Linux alongside Windows remains the ultimate solution. Since Linux comes in different distributions and flavors, the standout contender for developers is Ubuntu. It offers a perfect balance of efficiency, stability, and user-friendliness, making it ideal for both beginners and advanced users. In this blog, we will walk you through the process of installing Ubuntu alongside Windows.



# 🐧 Complete Guide: Installing Ubuntu Using Dual Boot (Windows + Ubuntu)

Dual booting allows you to run **Windows and Ubuntu on the same machine**, choosing the OS at startup.

This guide covers:
- Clean dual boot installation
- Proper partitioning
- UEFI vs Legacy BIOS
- Common errors (GPT/MBR mismatch, boot issues, etc.)

---

## 📌 Requirements

- USB (8GB+)
- Ubuntu ISO (Download from official site)
- Rufus (for creating bootable USB)
- At least 25–50GB free disk space
- Backup of important data ⚠️

---

# Step 1 — Check Your System Type (UEFI or Legacy)

In Windows:

1. Press `Win + R`
2. Type `msinfo32`
3. Check **BIOS Mode**

- If it says **UEFI → You must use GPT**
- If it says **Legacy → You must use MBR**

⚠️ **Important:** Windows and Ubuntu must use the SAME partition scheme.

---

# Step 2 — Create Bootable USB

Using **Rufus**:

- Select Ubuntu ISO
- Partition scheme:
  - GPT → for UEFI
  - MBR → for Legacy BIOS
- File system: FAT32
- Click Start

---

# Step 3 — Create Free Space in Windows

1. Open Disk Management
2. Right-click C Drive
3. Click **Shrink Volume**
4. Shrink at least 30GB

You should now see **Unallocated Space**

Do NOT create a new volume.

---

# Step 4 — Boot from USB

1. Restart PC
2. Press Boot Menu key (F12, F9, Esc depending on laptop)
3. Select USB

Choose: **Install Ubuntu**

---

# Step 5 — Installation Type

When you reach:

## "Installation Type"

Choose:

### Option 1 (Easy Way)
> Install Ubuntu alongside Windows Boot Manager

### Option 2 (Advanced – Recommended)
> Something Else

If selecting **Something Else**, create:

| Partition | Size | Type | Mount Point |
|-----------|------|------|-------------|
| Root      | 25GB+| ext4 | /           |
| Swap      | 4GB  | swap | -           |
| EFI (If UEFI) | 512MB | FAT32 | /boot/efi |

---

# Step 6 — Install and Restart

After installation:

- Remove USB
- Restart
- You should see **GRUB Boot Menu**
- Choose Ubuntu or Windows

---

# 🎉 Ubuntu Installed Successfully!

Now update system:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade -y
```
# ⚠️ Common Errors & Fixes

---

## ❌ 1. GPT vs MBR Mismatch

### Problem:

- Windows installed using **GPT**
- Ubuntu USB created using **MBR**

### Result:

- Installation fails  
- OR Ubuntu does not boot  

### Solution:

Make sure both operating systems use the **same partition scheme**.

To check disk type in Windows:

Disk Management → Right Click Disk → Properties → Volumes → Partition Style

---

## ❌ 2. Ubuntu Not Booting After Installation

### Problem:

- PC boots directly into Windows.

### Solution:

1. Enter **BIOS**
2. Change **Boot Order**
3. Set **Ubuntu** as the first boot option  

**OR**

Disable Fast Startup in Windows:

Control Panel → Power Options → Choose what the power button does → Uncheck Fast Startup


---

## ❌ 3. New Ubuntu Version Not Installing

Sometimes the latest Ubuntu version (e.g., 24.xx) fails due to:

- GPU driver issues  
- Secure Boot conflicts  
- BIOS incompatibility  

### Fix:

Install an older stable version such as:

- **Ubuntu 20.04 LTS**

After installation, update using the terminal:

```bash
sudo do-release-upgrade
```
OR
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt full-upgrade -y
```
## ❌ 4. Custom Boot Repair (If GRUB is Missing)

If Ubuntu does not appear in the boot menu:

Boot using USB → Select Try Ubuntu → Open Terminal

Run:
```bash
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:yannubuntu/boot-repair
sudo apt update
sudo apt install boot-repair
boot-repair
```
